          <h2>1. Why These Guidelines Matter</h2>
          <p>
            GospelWed exists to help Christian singles pursue Christ-centered marriages. These Community Guidelines
            spell
            out the standards I expect every member to uphold so I can maintain a safe, respectful, and faith-aligned
            community.
            They sit alongside my Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and are enforced by me.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Authenticity &amp; Intent</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use your real identity, including name, age, marital status, and denominational background.</li>
            <li>Be transparent about your intention to pursue marriage; casual dating, friendship-only use, or
              solicitation is not permitted.</li>
            <li>Guardians creating profiles must have documented consent from the person they represent and keep details
              accurate.</li>
            <li>Do not create duplicate accounts or allow others to access your profile.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. Respectful Communication</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Speak with kindness and empathy; avoid harassment, bullying, or language that demeans faith, culture, or
              personal background.</li>
            <li>Do not pressure anyone to share personal information, meet offline, or respond immediately.</li>
            <li>After a match, honour boundaries around contact frequency, tone, and expectations of next steps.</li>
            <li>Report any suspicious outreach, scam attempts, or inappropriate content through the in-app tools.</li>

              rejected.</li>

            <li>Do not share photos or documents containing sensitive personal data such as IDs, financial records, or
              third-party information.</li>
            <li>Private photos unlocked after a match are strictly confidential. Screenshots, downloads, or sharing are
              violations that may lead to bans.</li>
